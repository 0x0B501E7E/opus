This is an attempt to write a low-latency audio codec. Don't bother with 
this unless you're interested in codec development. Certainly don't expect 
this to be ready any time soon. Oh, and don't complain if it sets your house
on fire.

To compile:
% ./configure
% make

To test the encoder:
% testcelt input.sw output.sw

where input.sw is a 16-bit (machine endian) *mono* audio file sampled at 
44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. The output file is already decompressed since we do not
currently produce compressed files. By default the bit-rate will be around 38 kbps, but replacing "mode1" by "mode2" in testcelt will encode at 58 kbps, which
is (sort of) suitable for music.
