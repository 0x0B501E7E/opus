CELT is a very low delay audio codec designed for high-quality communications.
Its potential uses include video-conferencing and network music performance.
The code is still in early stage, so it may be broken from time to time and
the bit-stream is not frozen yet, so it is different from one version to 
another. Oh, and don't complain if it sets your house on fire.

To compile:
% ./configure
% make

To test the encoder:
% testcelt <rate> <channels> <frame size> <bytes per packet> input.sw output.sw

where input.sw is a 16-bit (machine endian) audio file sampled at 
44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. The output file is already decompressed. 
the <rate> parameter is the number of bytes per packet to use.

Alternatively, there are now Ogg-based tools in tools/. Use 
the --help option for details. These are quite similar to the
speexenc/speexdec tools.
