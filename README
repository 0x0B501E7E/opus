This is an attempt to write a low-latency audio codec. Don't bother with 
this unless you're interested in codec development. Certainly don't expect 
this to be ready any time soon. Oh, and don't complain if it sets your house
on fire.

To compile:
% ./configure
% make

To test the encoder:
% testcelt <rate> <channels> <frame size> <bytes per packet> input.sw output.sw

where input.sw is a 16-bit (machine endian) audio file sampled at 
44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. The output file is already decompressed. 
the <rate> parameter is the number of bytes per packet to use.

Alternatively, there are now Ogg-based tools in tools/. Use 
the --help option for details. These are quite similar to the
speexenc/speexdec tools.
