This is a prototype codec and for now it doesn't do anything useful. To get
the celt and silk submodules, you need to do:

% git submodule init
% git submodule update

Compiling is currently tricky. You first need to configure the CELT directory:

% cd celt
% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure --disable-shared
% cd ..

Then you can use the top-level Makefile by typing:

% make

If you're lucky, then everything works. Most likely there will be an error in
one of the paths that are hardcoded into one of the makefiles. This should
improve in the future.
