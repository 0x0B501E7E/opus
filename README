This is a prototype codec and for now it has limited functionality. 

To build from a distribution tarball, you only need to do the following:

% ./configure --disable-shared
% make

To build from the git repository, the following steps are necessary

0) Clone the repository:

% git clone git://git.xiph.org/users/jm/ietfcodec.git
% cd ietfcodec

1) Get the celt and silk submodules:

% git submodule update --init

2) Compiling

% ./autogen.sh
% ./configure --disable-shared
% make


Once you have compiled the codec, there will be a test_harmony executable in
the src/ directory. This can be in the following way:

% ./test_harmony 48000 1 960 80 input.sw output.sw

The arguments are:
1) The sampling rate (only 48000 supported for now)
2) The number of channels (only mono supported for now)
3) The frame size in samples (480 and 960 supported)
4) Number of compressed bytes per frame (80 here means 32 kb/s)
5) Input PCM file (16-bit, machine endian)
6) Output PCM file after encoding and decoding (16-bit machine endian)
