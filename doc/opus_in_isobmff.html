4 Design Rules of Encapsulation
    4.1 File Type Indentification<a name="4.1"></a>
        This specification does not define any brand to declare files are conformant to this specification.
        TODO: Should we define such brands, e.g. 'Opus'? If we define the brand(s), we can utilize files conformant to
              this specification for the storage of Opus coded bitstreams without other derived file formats.
              It is not preferable that encapsulation of Opus bitstreams with only the brands of the ISO Base Media File
              Format, though files conformant to this specification are compatible with certain versions of the ISO
              Base Media File Format. See ISO/IEC 14496-12 [3] E.1 Introduction.
              If you desire that this file format is an alternative file format to the Ogg Opus, I recommend you define.

            +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+------------------------------+

            It is strongly recommended that the Movie Fragment Header Box and the Track Fragment Header Box be
            placed first in their container.
            Boxes marked with an asterisk (*) may be present.
            For some boxes listed above, the additional requirements, restrictions, recommendations and definitions
            are specified in 4.7 Additional Requirements, Restrictions, Recommendations and Definitions for Boxes in
            this specification.
            For the others, the definition is as is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 [1].
<a name="4.3"></a>
    4.3 Byte Order
        The fields in the boxes are stored as big-endian format.
        All Opus samples are processed byte-by-byte. Therefore, the endianness has nothing to do with any Opus sample.
<a name="4.4"></a>
    4.4 Definition of Opus sample
        4.4.1 Opus sample<a name="4.4.1"></a>
            An Opus sample is exactly one Opus packet for each of different Opus bitstreams. Due to support more than
            two channels, an Opus sample can contain frames from multiple Opus bitstreams but all Opus packets shall
            share with the total of frame sizes in a single Opus sample.
            In this specification, 'sample' means 'Opus sample' except for 'padded samples', 'priming samples', 'valid
            sample' and 'sample-accurate', i.e. 'sample' is 'sample' in the term defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 [1].
            TODO: If an Opus sample consists of multiple Opus streams, it can be splitted into individual streams and
                  reconstructed into new Opus samples as long as every Opus stream has the same total duration in each
                  Opus sample. This requires additional channel mapping at outside of the existing Opus Specific Box.
                  The solution may be achieved by using track references and new channel mapping/layout indications.
                  Or should we forbid splitting into multiple tracks to avoid more complex implementations?
                  Or just use channel mapping other than what the existing Opus Specific Box does, such as bit masks?

        4.4.2 Duration of Opus sample<a name="4.4.2"></a>
            The duration of Opus sample is given by multiplying the least common multiple of the frame size in seconds
            of all frames inside Opus sample by the value of the timescale field in the Media Header Box.

            To indicate the valid samples excluding the padded samples at the end of Opus bitstream, the duration of
            the last Opus sample of an Opus bitstream is given by multiplying the number of the valid samples by the
            value produced by dividing the value of the timescale field in the Media Header Box by 48000.
<a name="4.5"></a>
    4.5 Random Access
        4.5.1 Random Access Point<a name="4.5.1"></a>
            All Opus samples can be independently decoded i.e. every Opus sample is a sync sample.
            Therefore, the Sync Sample Box shall not be present.

        4.5.2 Pre-roll<a name="4.5.2"></a>
            Opus requires at least 80 milli-second pre-roll after each random access.
            Pre-roll is indicated by the roll_distance field in AudioRollRecoveryEntry. AudioPreRollEntry shall not be
            used since every Opus sample is a sync sample in Opus bitstream.
            Note that roll_distance is expressed in sample units in a term of ISO Base Media File Format, and always
            takes negative values.

            For the requirement of AudioRollRecoveryEntry, the compatible_brands field in the File Type Box and/or
            the Segment Type Box shall contain at least one brand which requires support for roll groups.
            See also 4.7.1 File Type Box and 4.7.2 Segment Type Box.
<a name="4.6"></a>
    4.6 Trimming of Actual Duration
        Due to the priming samples (or the padding at the beginning) derived from the pre-roll for the startup and the
        padding at the end, we need trim from media to get the actual duration before encoded.
        An edit in the Edit List Box can achieve this demand.
        For sample-accurate trimming, proper timescale should be set to the timescale field in the Movie Header Box
        and the Media Header Box inside Track Box(es) for Opus bitstream.

        The Edit List Box is applied to whole movie including all movie fragments. Therefore, it is impossible to tell
        the actual duration in the case producing movie fragments on the fly such as live-streaming. In such cases,
        the duration of the last Opus sample may be helpful.
        TODO: Should we define a new box which indicates the last Opus samples?
              Since this specification allows multiple sample descriptions, i.e. allows concatenation of multiple Opus
              bitstreams in a track, each Opus bitstream contains some padded samples.
              Without such a box, we cannot know in container level whether an Opus sample is the last Opus sample in
              an Opus bitstream or not. Is this preferable?

        See also 4.7.6 Edit List Box.
<a name="4.7"></a>
    4.7 Additional Requirements, Restrictions, Recommendations and Definitions for Boxes
        4.7.1 File Type Box<a name="4.7.1"></a>
            For any track containing Opus bitstreams, the following requirements are applied.
            + compatible_brands:
                The compatible_brands fields shall contain at least one brand which requires support for roll groups
                (e.g. the 'iso2' brand).
                When enabling movie fragments and placing at least one Sample Group Description Box in Movie Fragments,
                the compatible_brands fields shall also contain at least one brand which requires support of Sample
                Group Description Boxes in Movie Fragments (e.g. the 'iso6' brand).

        4.7.2 Segment Type Box<a name="4.7.2"></a>
            For any track containing Opus bitstreams, the following requirements are applied.
            + compatible_brands:
                The same requirements as specified at 4.7.1 File Type Box are applied.

        4.7.3 Movie Header Box<a name="4.7.3"></a>
            If any track containing Opus bitstreams, the following recommendations are applied.
            + timescale:
                The timescale field should be set to the same value of the timescale field in the Media Header Box
                inside Track Box(es) for Opus bitstream if no tracks for bitstreams other than Opus bitstream is present.

        4.7.4 Track Header Box<a name="4.7.4"></a>
            For any track containing Opus bitstreams, the following requirements are applied.
            + layer:
                The layer field shall be set to 0.
            + matrix:
                The matrix field shall be set to { 0x00010000,0,0,0,0x00010000,0,0,0,0x40000000 }.
            + width:
                The width field shall be set to 0.
            + height:
                The height field shall be set to 0.

        4.7.5 Edit Box<a name="4.7.5"></a>
            For any track containing Opus bitstreams, exactly one Edit Box shall be present.

        4.7.6 Edit List Box<a name="4.7.6"></a>
            For any track containing Opus bitstreams, exactly one Edit List Box shall be present. In addition, for
            non-empty edits, the following recommendations are applied.
            + segment_duration:
                The segment_duration field is used to indicate the actual duration of Opus bitstream.
                When the value of the timescale field in the Movie Header Box is equal to 48000, the segment_duration
                should be set to the number of the actual samples before encoded.
                When enabling movie fragments, the segment_duration field may be set to 0. The value 0 represents
                implicit duration equal to the sum of the duration of all samples. This would be helpful for excluding
                padded samples from the presentation timeline when producing movie fragments on the fly.
            + media_time:
                The media_time field is used to remove the priming samples of Opus bitstream.
                When the value of the timescale field in the Media Header Box is equal to 48000, the media_time shall
                be set to the number of priming samples to remove the priming samples for the first non-empty edit.

                    unsigned int(8 * (2 + OutputChannelCount)) ChannelMappingTable;
                }
            }

            + version:
                The version field shall be set to 0.
                In the future versions of this specification, this field may be set to other values. And without support

            + flags:
                The following flags are defined in the dflags:
                    0x000001 pre-skip-present:
                        This flag indicates the presence of the PreSkip field.
            + PreSkip:
                The PreSkip field shall be set to the same value as the *Pre-skip* field in the identification header
                defined in Ogg Opus [4]. Note that the value is stored as big-endian format.

                number of the priming samples.
                This field is not used for removing the priming samples at playback.
            + InputSampleRate:
                The InputSampleRate field shall be set to the same value as the *Input Sample Rate* field in the
                identification header defined in Ogg Opus [4]. Note that the value is stored as big-endian format.
            + OutputGain:
                The OutputGain field shall be set to the same value as the *Output Gain* field in the identification
                header define in Ogg Opus [4]. Note that the value is stored as big-endian format.
